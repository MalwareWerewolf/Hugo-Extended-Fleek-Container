I have already added this container to my [Decentralized blog repository](https://github.com/MalwareWerewolf/malwarewerewolf-decentralized/tree/main), but I thought it would have been a better idea to have its own repository.

I never really found on the Docker Hub any working Docker images to deploy containers through Fleek, so I decided to create mine, which will always use the latest version of Hugo.

You can also find the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/drakobombo/hugo-extended-fleek) on the Docker Hub.
